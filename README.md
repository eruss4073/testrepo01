# TestRepo001
test_practice making a repo_my first on GitHub;   
I'm doing this as part of a Coursera course;   
This is a second edit for practice;   
This is the third edit, or commit.  

I've published this as a gh pages project.

I've added a series of links to markdown docs. The user could go to the alternate doc, and then go into subfolder from there, or they could simply go directy to the md doc in the subfolder.
