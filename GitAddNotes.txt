#first navigate to directory of interest#
cd ~/"My Documents/Git/testrepo01/"
#We'll assume that we added a file to the repo(directory)#

#then add the file of interest to the Git index#
git add -A
#the -A flag specifies that all new files are to be added, and updates the#
#tracking for all files that changed names or were deleted#

#next, we want to commit (create a snapshot) the changes we've#
#made. Here, that is the addition of a file to our repository#
git commit -m "type a message like 'added txt file'" 

#next we pull updates from GitHub providing two arguments to the#
#'git pull' command. we provide the source to pull from 'origin'#
#and the branch of interest e.g. 'master'#
git pull origin master

#now we can push our 'added' and 'committed' changes to GitHub using#
#the same arguments for destination and branch as for git pull#
git push origin master
